# STAT 4996: Applied Statistics Captone 
## Optimizing Cavalier Autonomous Racing (CAR) Vehicle Performance 

Throughout the Fall 2024 semester, I worked with 3 other students to complete my B.A. in Applied Statistics Capstone project. Using data from the Cavalier Autonomous Racing (CAR) vehicle, our project sought to optimize racing performance, motivated by a spin-out and crash at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 2024. By the end of the semester, we implemented 3 algorithms into the vehicle's software to balance wheel load and improve lag associated with steering and acceleration commands. The 'Results Report.pdf' is a 16-page write-up describing our project work and process. 

This website describes our project at a high-level: <https://avcapstone-site.vercel.app/>.
